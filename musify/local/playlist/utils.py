    :param tracks: Optional. Available Tracks to search through for matches.
        If no tracks are given, the playlist instance will load all the tracks from scratch according to its settings.
    :param path_mapper: Optionally, provide a :py:class:`PathMapper` for paths stored in the playlist file.
        Useful if the playlist file contains relative paths and/or paths for other systems that need to be
        mapped to absolute, system-specific paths to be loaded and back again when saved.
    :param remote_wrangler: Optionally, provide a RemoteDataWrangler object for processing URIs on tracks.
        If given, the wrangler can be used when calling __get_item__ to get an item from the collection from its URI.
        The wrangler is also used when loading tracks to allow them to process URI tags.
